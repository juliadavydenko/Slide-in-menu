    <p>This is a showcase of a navigation menu with a burger icon that transforms into an "X" shape when the menu is opened. A slide-in menu is a type of navigation menu that smoothly appears on the screen by sliding in from the edge of the viewport when triggered. It's a common design pattern used in web and mobile applications to provide access to additional navigation options or content without taking up too much space on the screen.</p>
    <p>The primary characteristic of a slide-in menu is its dynamic and animated behavior. When activated, the menu often slides into view, overlaying part of the main content or pushing the content to the side. This allows users to interact with the menu and access its items while still being able to see part of the main content. In this example, I was using HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
